As an architect turned UX designer I have many strong opinions about my former and current profession. But in short, I am now enjoying the greener pastures I expected while studying architecture that the profession didn’t provide.

Many like-minded architects ask me when and why I decided to transition into software. This puts me in the dubious position of praising the initial skill-set achieved by studying architecture, while promoting departure from it. That said, I have a very abstract definition of architecture, and believe if you have the interest to pursue any other design discipline, you’ll be successful. This guide is intended for those driven and curious architects looking for a change.

## Is this right for you?

Your current work fulfills you creatively, financially, and socially.

You’re already Principal of a successful growing firm.

You’re averse of change.

You simply don’t have any interest to change career paths.

You prefer a slower growing career.

Your definition of Architecture is designing “buildings” and nothing else.

If any of that sounds like you, then thanks for reading but you can stop here. If not, then you should consider a career in software as a UX designer.

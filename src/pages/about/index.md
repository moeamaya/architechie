### A community of design ballers
Architechie is an organization founded by a group of former architects that bridges the gap between architecture and technology. The core group of founders is now working in fields including experience design, augmented reality, smart homes, and transportation innovation.

We hold workshops, guest lectures, and panel discussions, promoting discourse related to design, emerging technology, and the built environment.
